# 🛡️ Netskope Log Parser Tool

## 📘 Purpose

This tool is designed to parse and analyze debug logs generated by the **Netskope client**. It helps security and IT administrators to quickly extract useful insights from logs including:

- **Bypassed and tunneled traffic** grouped by process and destination host.
- **Netskope PoP connection history** and **latency (RTT)**.
- **Traffic steering modes** and current connected gateway.
- **Client metadata** (OS version, hostname, Netskope client version, tenant name).
- **General warnings and errors** including SSL and connectivity issues.

The tool presents the results in a web-based interface with grouped, collapsible views, and allows exporting data to CSV.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Upload a `.log` file via the interface.
### 2. Optionally specify a time window (e.g., last 10 minutes).
### 3. View results organized by:
   - Process and host
   - Errors & RTTs
   - Metadata and steering settings
